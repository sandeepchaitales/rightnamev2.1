<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user wants to build a consulting-grade brand name evaluation system named RIGHTNAME. This system should analyze brand names based on a rich set of user inputs including industry, category, product type, USP, brand vibe, and market scope. The output must be an interactive dashboard with an optional investor-ready PDF export.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  **Core Analysis**: The system must analyze names against multiple frameworks (Brand Distinctiveness, Cultural Resonance, Trademark Risk, etc.).
2.  **NameScore Index**: Produce a composite NameScore Index (0-100) and a final verdict (GO, CONDITIONAL GO, REJECT, NO-GO).
3.  **Advanced Competitor Analysis**: Implement a Strategic Positioning Matrix and use Customer Avatar and Intent Matching to distinguish true competitors.
4.  **Advanced Availability Checks**: Perform multi-domain and social media handle availability checks.
5.  **Plan B Feature**: For rejected names, suggest alternative brand names and identify poison words.
6.  **UI/UX**: Provide a rich input form and a multi-section dashboard to display all analysis results. The UI should be professional, playful, and fun, with a modern design aesthetic.
7.  **Phonetic & String Similarity**: Implement pre-LLM checks to catch phonetic and string similarity conflicts.
8.  **Authentication**: Add Google Sign-In and standard email/password authentication.
9.  **Freemium Model**: Unregistered users see a partial report (Executive Summary & Score only). They must register or sign in to view the full report. The system must save the partial report and unlock it after registration without re-generating.
10. **Deployment & Custom Domain**: The application must be deployable and work on a custom domain ().
11. **Print-Ready PDF**: The exported PDF report must be professionally designed, responsive, and optimized for portrait A4/Letter format, with no sections breaking across pages.
12. **Report Previews**: Add engaging, auto-sliding report previews on the landing page to encourage user sign-ups.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**: A full-stack React/FastAPI application, RIGHTNAME. It has a complete authentication system supporting both Google Sign-In and email/password registration. A freemium model is in place, showing partial reports to guest users and unlocking the full report upon authentication. Auth state is reliably persisted in . The frontend features a highly stylized, playful UI, including an auto-sliding carousel on the landing page that previews report sections. The main dashboard has undergone a massive revamp to match this new design language and to include all data sections requested by the user, based on a reference PDF they provided. The system is designed to produce a print-perfect PDF by avoiding page breaks within content cards.

**Last working item**: The agent had just performed a full rebuild of the  component to include numerous missing sections based on a user-provided PDF. However, the user pointed out that three specific data points were still missing from the new UI: the  in the Legal Risk Matrix, a complete list of all social handles (not just available ones), and the detailed , , and  within the Final Assessment section. The agent was in the process of fixing these display issues.

-   **Last item agent was working**: Fixing the display of missing data points within the , , and  sections on the newly rebuilt  page.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N (The agent identified the data structure but has not yet implemented and tested the final fix).
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool. The agent should first generate a report to confirm the data is present in the API response, then take a screenshot of the dashboard to verify the UI now correctly renders all the missing pieces of information.
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1**: Missing data in the revamped report UI. (P0)

**Issues Detail**:
-   **Issue 1**:
    -   **Description**: Despite a full rebuild of the dashboard, several key data points are not being rendered.
        1.   is missing the , , and  subsections.
        2.   is missing the  column (the data is in the  field).
        3.   only shows available handles, not the status of all checked platforms.
    -   **Attempted fixes**: The agent correctly identified the backend data structure for these missing items from the API response ( array, , and the full  object).
    -   **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Use the  tool on .
        2.  In the  component, map over the  array to render each recommendation's title and content.
        3.  In the  component, ensure the table renders the  data in the Mitigation Strategy column.
        4.  In the  component, update the logic to map over the entire  array and display each platform with its corresponding status (, , ).
        5.  Take a screenshot after generating a new report to verify all missing data is now visible.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This will complete the dashboard rebuild, finally aligning the UI with the user's detailed requirements and the data provided by the backend.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: Y (The issue of data not being rendered correctly has occurred multiple times).
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks**:
    -   **Task 1**: Deploy all recent changes (Freemium model, UI revamp, print fixes) to the production environment. (P0)
-   **Future Tasks**:
    -   **Task 1**: Scale the application to handle 100-200 concurrent users. (P1)
        -   **Plan**: Implement a background job queue system (e.g., Celery with Redis) to process report generation asynchronously. Implement an email notification system to inform the user when their report is ready.
    -   **Task 2**: Refactor  to break down the monolithic  endpoint. (P2)
    -   **Task 3**: Refactor  (currently 900+ lines) into smaller, manageable components. (P2)
    -   **Task 4**: Refactor  to use a more structured prompt-building system instead of a single large string. (P2)

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Freemium Model & Auth**: Implemented a full email/password registration and login system. Created a gated content experience where users must sign in to see the full report.
-   **Auth Persistence Fix**: Resolved post-login navigation issues by using  to reliably persist authentication state, ensuring users see the unlocked report immediately.
-   **CORS & API Fixes**: Fixed several CORS and API URL issues that were preventing frontend authentication calls from working in the development environment.
-   **Landing Page Report Preview**: Added a dynamic, auto-sliding carousel on the landing page to showcase sample report sections and encourage sign-ups.
-   **Full Report UI Revamp**: Completely redesigned the dashboard report to match the playful and professional aesthetic of the landing page carousel, using gradients, icons, and better typography.
-   **Print-Friendly PDF Export**: Added CSS rules () to prevent cards and sections from being cut off during printing, creating a clean, multi-page PDF output.
-   **Dashboard Rebuild**: Performed a complete rebuild of the  component to incorporate all missing data sections identified by the user from a reference PDF.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Unable to generate report and data not appearing correctly in the UI.
-   **Recurrence count**: High. The issue of UI not matching the available data has been the primary driver of work in this session.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS (The specific instance of missing data is being fixed).

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Pydantic,  for password hashing,  for JWTs.
-   **Frontend**: React, , , ,  for the slider.
-   **Authentication**: Dual system with Emergent-managed Google Auth and custom email/password JWT authentication. State is persisted in .
-   **Print Styling**: Advanced CSS (, ) for generating professional PDFs from HTML.

**key DB schema**
-   **users**: 
-   **reports**: 
-   **user_sessions**:  (For Google Auth)

**changes in tech stack**
-   **Backend**: Added  and  for email/password authentication.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.js**: The main file worked on. It was completely rebuilt and is now over 900 lines. It contains the logic for rendering the entire report.
-   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js**: Heavily modified to add email/password login/registration logic and  persistence.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Modified to add all new authentication endpoints (, , , ), report storage/retrieval endpoints, and updated CORS policies.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.js**: Updated to include the new  carousel.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthModal.js**: New component for handling user sign-in and registration.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ReportPreview.js**: New component for the auto-sliding carousel.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AuthCallback.js**: Updated to handle redirection after Google login correctly.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-    is now extremely large and complex. It urgently needs to be broken down into smaller, self-contained components for each report section (e.g., , , ).
-    remains a monolith with business logic, auth, and data fetching mixed.
-    is a large, hard-to-maintain string.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Core endpoint for brand analysis.
-   : New endpoint for email/password user creation.
-   : New endpoint for email/password user login.
-   : Endpoint to clear the session cookie.
-   : Fetches the current user profile from the session.
-   : Fetches a saved report by its ID.
-   : Initiates Google login.
-   : Handles the OAuth2 callback.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **User is detail-oriented**: The user will meticulously check if every piece of data from the backend is rendered in the UI, comparing it to previous reports or their mental model. Do not mark a task as complete until you have visually verified every single data point is displayed correctly.
-   **Dashboard is monolithic**: The file  is now over 900 lines long. Be extremely careful when editing it. The best long-term strategy is to propose breaking it down into smaller components.
-   **Authentication is via localStorage**: The primary mechanism for persisting login status on the frontend is . The  hook reads from this. This was a deliberate choice to bypass cross-domain cookie issues.
-   **Data structure is key**: Before fixing any UI display issue, first use  to inspect the JSON response from the  endpoint. The bug is almost always a mismatch between the component's expected data path and the actual data path in the JSON.
